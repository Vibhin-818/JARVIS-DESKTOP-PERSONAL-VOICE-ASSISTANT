3. Application Launching: Users can open applications like Notepad, Chrome, or the Command Prompt.
4. Internet Interaction: It can open websites, search YouTube, and retrieve Wikipedia summaries.
5. Communication: Users can send WhatsApp messages and emails.
6. Entertainment: It can play songs and tell jokes.
